Then, first, try to simply remove the key for the course server from your local machine by executing the following command:



If this works, then SSH will tell you to re-approve the remote host (sysprog.runi.ac.il) and you just need to type "yes".
If you still get an error message similar to the above, 
then you need to edit the file ~/.ssh/known_hosts on your computer (using pico or any other text editor).
===> pico ~/.ssh/known_hosts
In the file, find the line where sysprog.runi.ac.il is mentioned, and delete it. 
The number of line should be mentioned in the error message that you get when you try to SSH (Offending ECDSA key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts:<NUMLINE>).
If you still can't make it work, then post a message to Piazza and we'll help you out. 
Sorry for the extra trouble.
