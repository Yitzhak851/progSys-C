    Right click PuTTY console window title;
    Select <Event Log>
    The very first entry in the log says:
    Connecting to <ip> port <port>
}

// Exit - How do I exit an SSH connection?
{
    Two ways:
    1) closing the shell session will usually exit, for example:
        with the shell builtin command (followed by Enter):
        ==> exit

    2) Ctrl-d
    (end-of-file) in the case where you have a bad connection and the shell is unresponsive, 
    hit the Enter key, then type ~. 
    and ssh should immediately close and return you to your command prompt.
    
    The first option should be intuitive, but how do we know the latter option?
    We could learn this information from a careful reading of the man page.
    $ man ssh
